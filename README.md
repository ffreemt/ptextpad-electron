A parallel text editor using electron

## TODOs
`ptextpad-el` currently just has `ezbee` automatic alignment support that replies on a remote server. Supports for `dzbee`, `debee` and `mlbee` along with a possible local server are in plan phase. Install packages for Linux/macOs will be provided later on. Stay tuned.

`Shortcuts` for moving a cell up/down will be implemented. `Shortcuts` for other convenient editing such as `spliting/combining` will also be implemented if feasible.

## Debug

Turn on debug
```
set TRACER_DEBUG=debug

# linux/macOS export TRACER_DEBUG=debug

```
and run `ptextpad-el` from command line

`ptextpad-el.exe` is by default installed in `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\ptextpad-el\ptextpad-el.exe` in Windows
